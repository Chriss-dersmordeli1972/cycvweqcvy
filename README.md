Okay, so first of all, A Working Man... like, what even was that ending? 😆 I swear, at one point, I was just like—my brain checked out. I mean, was it trying to say something deep or did it get lost halfway? Ugh, you know what I mean, right?

The beginning had me hooked though. I was like, okay, I can vibe with this dude’s life; it’s got this old-school grit. But then it kinda just drifted into this thing where I'm not even sure if I cared anymore. And the main guy? Didn’t you feel like he was just overthinking everything like chill, man! Life’s messy, we get it.

> But then, like, wait, did you notice how the music kept getting all dramatic? I mean, c’mon, tone it down a notch, Beethoven. 😅 I was just there munching popcorn like it was the damn finale or something. Speaking of which, I gotta ask... did you actually feel any closure at the end? Or was it just me staring at the credits, thinking about how I could’ve been napping?

Swear, the part where he’s just working late and having deep thoughts, made me wanna just scream, Bro, just download the movie in your head and move on! Like, seriously!

And then when I thought, hmm, maybe I should try to be more engaged, the story did this super slow burn thing that nearly put me to sleep. Made me wish I'd just watch the movie with one eye open, you know? Yet, like, I couldn’t even bring myself to pause it cause FOMO is real. 🤦‍♂️

Random moment of brilliance: Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'Keep watching' : 'Take a nap'

So, anyway, not to rant or anything, but yeah, I'd say it’s one of those you watch with a grain of salt and a side of disbelief. Or maybe I’m just overthinking much like our guy from the film. 😂 Let's just plan to chat about anything else next time, deal?
